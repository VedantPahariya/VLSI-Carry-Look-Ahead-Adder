# VLSI-Carry-Look-Ahead-Adder

## Project Overview

Developed a complete 4-bit Carry Lookahead Adder (CLA) at transistor level with the following accomplishments:

- Designed optimal circuit topology with precise transistor sizing using Ngspice
- Performed post-layout simulation using Magic tool
- Implemented and verified functionality through Verilog and GtkWave simulation
- Successfully tested the design on FPGA hardware

This project demonstrates end-to-end digital circuit design from transistor-level implementation to hardware verification.
